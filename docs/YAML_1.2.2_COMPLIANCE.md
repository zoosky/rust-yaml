# YAML 1.2.2 Compliance

This document tracks `rust-yaml`'s conformance to the [YAML 1.2.2 specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) and notes deviations from / compatibility with [YAML 1.1](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/).

It is **descriptive**, not aspirational: every entry below reflects the current behavior of the codebase on `main`. Code/test references are included so this doc can be audited against the source.

## Legend

- ✅ **Implemented** — feature works and has test coverage.
- 🟡 **Partial** — works for the common case but has documented gaps.
- ❌ **Gap** — required by the spec but not yet implemented.
- 🔵 **Out of scope (1.1 only)** — feature exists in YAML 1.1 only; intentionally not part of 1.2.2.
- ⏸ **Deferred** — recognized requirement, not prioritized for the current milestone.

## YAML 1.2.2 chapter-by-chapter

### Chapter 5 — Character productions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UTF-8 input | ✅ | Strings are `&str`, encoding handled by Rust |
| UTF-16 / UTF-32 BOM detection | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Indicator characters (`[ ] { } , - ? : ! & * # ; , > \| ' " % @ \``) | ✅ | Recognized by the scanner |
| Escape sequences in `"..."` scalars (`\n`, `\t`, `\x..`, `\u....`, `\U........`) | 🟡 | Common escapes work; full table not exhaustively tested |
| Line break normalization (`\r\n` → `\n`) | ✅ | Handled in scanner |

### Chapter 6 — Structural productions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Indentation (spaces only, no tabs) | ✅ | `src/scanner/indentation.rs` |
| `# comment` | ✅ | `tests/comment_preservation_tests.rs` |
| `%YAML version` directive parsed | ✅ | `src/parser/mod.rs:319` populates `yaml_version` |
| `%YAML 1.1` honored for bool resolution | ✅ | Composers read `Event::DocumentStart`'s version and call `resolver::resolve_plain_scalar(value, version)` (`src/composer.rs`, `composer_borrowed.rs`, `composer_comments.rs`, `composer_optimized.rs`). 1.1 enables `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` as bools; 1.2 (default) does not. See `tests/directives.rs` `test_yaml_version_1_1_compatibility` and siblings. |
| `%YAML 1.1` honored for `=` / `!!value` | ❌ | `=` still parses as `String("=")` even under 1.1. Tracked as a known gap below. |
| `%TAG handle prefix` directive | ✅ | `tests/directives.rs`, `tests/directive_roundtrip.rs` |
| Reserved directive handling | 🟡 | Other directives parse but are not strictly validated |

### Chapter 7 — Flow style productions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Flow sequences `[a, b, c]` | ✅ | `tests/flow_indent_bug.rs` |
| Flow mappings `{k: v}` | ✅ | |
| Plain scalars in flow context | ✅ | |
| Single-quoted scalars `'...'` with `''` escape | ✅ | |
| Double-quoted scalars `"..."` with backslash escapes | ✅ | See Chapter 5 caveat |
| Empty flow collections `[]` / `{}` | ✅ | Fixed in [#3](../../issues/3) via `448e3f6` |

### Chapter 8 — Block style productions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Block sequences (`- item`) | ✅ | Compact and extra-indented forms — fixed in `448e3f6` |
| Block mappings (`key: value`) | ✅ | |
| Block sequences nested in mappings | ✅ | The case from [#3](../../issues/3) |
| Literal block scalars (`\|`, chomping `\|-`, `\|+`) | ✅ | |
| Folded block scalars (`>`, chomping `>-`, `>+`) | ✅ | |
| Explicit block keys (`? key`) | ✅ | `tests/complex_keys.rs` |
| Indentation indicator (`\|2`, `>4`) | 🟡 | Parsing works; less-common combinations not exhaustively tested |

### Chapter 9 — Document stream productions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `---` document start marker | ✅ | `tests/directives.rs` |
| `...` document end marker | ✅ | |
| Multi-document streams | ✅ | `Yaml::load_all_str` / `dump_all_str` |
| Implicit document (no `---`) | ✅ | |
| Bare document with directives | ✅ | |

### Chapter 10 — Recommended schemas

| Schema | Status | Constants |
|---|---|---|
| Failsafe (`!!map`, `!!seq`, `!!str`) | ✅ | `Schema::Failsafe` in `src/tag.rs:342` |
| JSON (adds `!!null`, `!!bool`, `!!int`, `!!float`) | ✅ | `Schema::Json` |
| **Core** (default) | ✅ | `Schema::Core` in `src/tag.rs:338`, default per `src/tag.rs:91` |

#### Core Schema resolution

Implicit (untagged) resolution happens in the **composer**, not the `Resolver` trait. Every composer variant (`src/composer.rs:300-318`, `composer_borrowed.rs:240-251`, `composer_comments.rs:195-206`, `composer_optimized.rs:240-251`) duplicates the same hardcoded sequence: try `i64::parse`, try `f64::parse`, try a YAML-1.1-style bool/null match, fall back to `String`. The `TagResolver` / `BasicResolver` is only consulted for **explicitly tagged** scalars like `!!int 0xFF`.

The table below was captured by parsing each input with `Yaml::new().load_str(...)` on `main` and recording the resulting `Value` variant:

| Input | Implicit result | Spec-correct under 1.2 Core | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `null`, `~` | `Null` ✅ | `!!null` | Composer path |
| `true` / `false` (any case) | `Bool` ✅ | `!!bool` | Composer matches case-insensitively |
| `yes` / `no` / `on` / `off` (no directive) | `String` ✅ | `!!str` | Fixed — composer reads `%YAML` version; `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` only resolve as `Bool` under `%YAML 1.1` |
| `42`, `-1` (decimal) | `Int` ✅ | `!!int` | `i64::parse` |
| `0xFF` (hex) | `String` ❌ | `!!int` | Only works via `!!int 0xFF` (`src/tag.rs:249`) |
| `0o17` (octal, 1.2 form) | `String` ❌ | `!!int` | Only works via `!!int 0o17` (`src/tag.rs:252`) |
| `0b101` (binary) | `String` 🔵 | n/a | Non-spec extension; works when tagged (`src/tag.rs:255`) |
| `014` (octal, 1.1 form) | `Int(14)` ✅ | `!!int 14` | Spec says decimal-14; rust-yaml agrees |
| `3.14`, `1e6` | `Float` ✅ | `!!float` | `f64::parse` |
| `inf`, `nan` (Rust forms) | `Float` ❌ | `!!str` | Composer's `f64::parse` accepts these — spec uses `.inf`/`.nan` |
| `.inf`, `-.inf`, `.nan` (spec forms) | `String` ❌ | `!!float` | Tagged construction works (`src/tag.rs:274-276`); implicit doesn't |
| anything else | `String` ✅ | `!!str` | Default fallback |

**Remaining Core Schema compliance gaps**:

1. Implicit hex / 1.2-octal integers (`0xFF`, `0o17`) resolve as strings — tagged forms (`!!int 0xFF`) work.
2. Spec float forms `.inf` / `.nan` resolve as strings while Rust forms `inf` / `nan` are wrongly resolved as floats — tagged forms work.
3. The `BasicResolver` / `TagResolver` `implicit_resolvers` HashMap (`src/resolver.rs:36-48`) is still unused; the active resolution path is now `resolver::resolve_plain_scalar`, which is shared by all composers. The `BasicResolver` lookup map could be removed in a follow-up.

**Resolved during [#10](../../issues/10)**:

- Composer code-path consolidation: all four composers now share `resolver::resolve_plain_scalar`, eliminating four near-identical inline resolution blocks.
- `%YAML 1.1` directive now governs bool resolution (`yes`/`no`/`on`/`off`).
- Scanner no longer rewrites `yes` → the literal string `"true"` — plain-scalar text reaches the composer unchanged.

## YAML 1.1 compatibility

YAML 1.1 includes types and behaviors that the 1.2 spec **explicitly removed** from the Core Schema. The table below shows where `rust-yaml` lands.

| 1.1 feature | 1.2 status | rust-yaml behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Boolean alternatives `yes/no/on/off` | Dropped (1.2 = `true`/`false` only) | ✅ Directive-aware. Under default 1.2 (or `%YAML 1.2`), `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` resolve as `String`. Under `%YAML 1.1`, they resolve as `Bool`. |
| Boolean short forms `y/n` | Dropped (1.2 = `true`/`false` only) | 🔵 Not recognized in either version. |
| Octal leading-zero `014` (= decimal 12 in 1.1) | Dropped (1.2 = `0o14`) | ❌ Resolved as decimal `Int(14)`, never as octal 12. Wrong for both 1.1 (should be 12) and arguably right for 1.2 (decimal interpretation matches `!!int`'s "implicit type implies decimal" rule). |
| `!!value` tag and `=` value-key replacement | Dropped from 1.2 Core | 🔵 Not recognized — `=` parses as the literal string `"="`. Spec-compliant for 1.2.2; differs from `ruamel` ([#1](../../issues/1)). |
| `!!merge` (`<<`) | Retained de facto | ✅ `tests/merge_keys.rs`, `tests/merge_keys_comprehensive.rs` |
| `!!binary` | Retained, base64 | ✅ `src/tag.rs:291-318` (decodes to `String` or marker for non-UTF-8) |
| `!!timestamp` | Retained, ISO 8601 | 🟡 Stub — `src/tag.rs:321-325` stores as `String("timestamp:<raw>")` |
| `!!omap`, `!!pairs`, `!!set` | Retained in 1.2 type repository | ⏸ Recognized as tag names but mapped to default `Mapping` |
| `%YAML 1.1` directive enables 1.1 bool resolution | — | ✅ Directive flows through `Event::DocumentStart` → composer → `resolver::resolve_plain_scalar`. See `tests/directives.rs::test_yaml_version_1_1_compatibility`. |
| `%YAML 1.1` directive enables `!!value` / `=` | — | ❌ Not yet — `=` still resolves to `String` under 1.1 (deferred). |

## Engine features beyond pure spec compliance

These are `rust-yaml`-specific and not part of any spec-conformance level:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Comment preservation through round-trip | ✅ | `tests/comment_preservation_tests.rs`, `LoaderType::RoundTrip` |
| Position info (line/column) on errors | ✅ | `src/position.rs` |
| Anchor / alias resolution | ✅ | `tests/integration_tests.rs` |
| Custom tag handlers (`register_handler`) | ✅ | `src/tag.rs` |
| JSON-Schema-style validation engine | ✅ | `src/schema.rs` (note: this is the *validation* schema, not the YAML resolution schema) |
| Streaming / event-based API | ✅ | `src/streaming_enhanced.rs`, `streaming_async.rs` |
| Borrowed / zero-copy values | ✅ | `src/value_borrowed.rs`, `src/zero_copy_value.rs` |
| Resource limits (max depth, max document size) | ✅ | `tests/security_limits.rs` |

## Known gaps tracked separately

- The Core Schema implicit `int` resolver only recognizes decimals — hex/octal/binary forms only typed when explicitly tagged.
- The Core Schema implicit `float` resolver uses Rust's `f64::parse` (accepts `inf`/`nan`), instead of the spec's `.inf`/`.nan` forms.
- `!!timestamp` construction is a stub.
- UTF-16/UTF-32 BOM detection at stream start.
- `%YAML 1.1` directive does not yet enable `!!value` / `=` token construction. `=` always parses as `String`.
- The `BasicResolver`'s `implicit_resolvers` HashMap is dead code now that `resolver::resolve_plain_scalar` is the single resolution path — candidate for removal in a follow-up.

## Maintaining this doc

When you add or change a spec-relevant feature:

1. Update the matching row above (move ❌/🟡 to ✅, or split a row).
2. Add a code/test reference so future maintainers can verify.
3. If a behavior diverges from 1.2.2 intentionally (e.g., for 1.1 interop), note it in the *YAML 1.1 compatibility* table — don't quietly drop spec compliance.
