Session 5 commits (377 → 534 = +157):

- `265ea5a` Implement §8.1.1.2 block-scalar chomping (clip/strip/keep)
  and fix `find_block_scalar_indent` single-line bug (+47, biggest
  single-commit win since session 2).
- `74decb8` Preserve folded line breaks adjacent to more-indented
  content per §8.1.3.2 (+4).
- `71451c9` `check_for_mapping_ahead` scans past inner `:` so plain
  scalars containing colons are still recognised as mapping keys (+4).
- `c3d29e9` Synthesise implicit empty value when a key is followed by
  another key with no intervening `:` (yaml-test-suite 7W2P), via the
  new `innermost_mapping_has_odd_children` helper (+4).
- `b338eaa` Synthesise implicit empty key when a line starts with `:`
  (2JQS) — handle ImplicitDocumentStart / DocumentContent /
  BlockMappingKey-even states; skip the "this scalar is a new key"
  heuristic immediately after a just-synthesised empty key (+5).
  60.0% milestone reached.
- `efcc96c` Keep anchor on key when `BlockMappingStart` wraps an
  implicit key — distinguish root-position implicit-key (anchor
  goes to key) from value-position (anchor goes to mapping) (+10).
- `955dedf` Preserve literal whitespace beyond `content_indent` on
  blank lines in block scalars per §6.5 (+9).
- `60c1072` Line-aware "scalar is value vs new key" heuristic: skip
  the missing-value synthesis when the scalar shares a line with the
  most recent `:` (yaml-test-suite 6M2F) (+2).
- `21b947d` Reject unclosed flow collections at end-of-stream per
  §7.4 — `[ [ a, b, c ]` and friends (+2).
- `ddb83d2` Reject stray `]` / `}` outside flow context (+2).
- `6d505f8` Reject block-scalar indent indicator `|0` per
  §8.1.1.1 (+1).
- `22fd82a` Reject leading or double commas in flow collections (+2).
- `a0a8229` Block-scalar `content_indent` is leading-space count
  (no `base_indent + 1` floor) per §8.1.1.1; unblocks block-scalar
  content collection inside sequence items (net 0 passes, but
  failure mode for 4QFQ/M6YH/P2AD now advances one event).
- `d46528e` Drop the strict multiple-of-N indentation rule
  (§6.1 has no such requirement) (+2). 64.1%.
- `e3704b1` Pass `pending_anchor` / `pending_tag` to synthesised
  empty mapping keys so anchored empty keys (\`&a : a\`) don't
  leak into the next anchor check (net 0).
- `da173eb` Detect leading quoted scalars as implicit mapping
  keys — `check_for_mapping_ahead` scans past the leading quote
  (with `''` and `\"` escape handling) before searching for `:`;
  shared the BMS-opening logic into `maybe_open_block_mapping_for_key`.
  Fixes 6H3V, 6SLA, 87E4-like cases (+6).
- `262c98f` Trim trailing whitespace before plain-scalar fold so
  `a\nb  \n  c\nd\n\ne` folds to `a b c d\ne` instead of leaking
  the trailing spaces (+6). 65.7%.
- `ae48850` Reject implicit mapping key without `:` at end of
  stream — tracks `explicit_key_pending` to distinguish from
  spec-legal `? key` (+2).
- `3983360` Re-run `handle_indentation` after a block scalar so
  the next sibling `-` / `key:` dispatches against fresh
  `current_indent` (+6).
- `f942073` Synth empty value at BlockEnd when innermost map has
  odd children (yaml-test-suite 7W2P) (+3).
- `9039477` Synth empty value for key-only flow mapping entries
  at FlowEntry / FlowMappingEnd (+6). 68.0%.
- `9715e31` Fold multi-line plain scalars in flow context — break
  at `\n`/`\r` in the flow-content match arm + relaxed column rule
  for continuation in flow (+6).
- `394e21c` Block-scalar `base_indent` reads from `indent_stack`
  (not stale `current_indent`) so `|N` inside a sequence item
  resolves correctly (+4).
- `83795c9` Parent-aware multi-line plain scalar continuation per
  §6.5 / §7.3.3 — continuation must be at column N+2 or deeper
  (parent block at indent N has keys at N+1) (+14, single biggest
  win in this stretch).
- `0e94cc8` Implicit single-pair flow mapping inside flow sequence
  per §7.5 — track open implicit pairs in
  `implicit_flow_pair_depth` so `,` / `]` close them before
  continuing the outer sequence (+10). **72.7%** milestone reached.

## Historical blockers (all resolved during 72.7 % → 100 % push)

The clusters below were the open work items at the 72.7 % milestone. All
are now passing in the 735 / 735 run; this section is preserved as
archaeology so future regressions can be traced back to the specific
fixtures and the area of the parser/scanner that owns them. If any test
in these clusters starts failing again, this is the map back to the
original problem statement.

### A. Strict-multiple-of-N indentation — resolved

Fixtures: **6HB6, 8G76, A2M4, F6MC, P94K, Q9WF, UGM3**.

The scanner's strict "indent must be a multiple of the first observed
width" check was replaced with the spec-correct rule (§6.1): siblings
share a column, children indent further, any positive amount works.
Latent wrong-accept / wrong-events bugs that this had been masking were
fixed in parallel (see clusters B–F).

### B. Block-scalar `{` / `}` content routing — resolved

Fixtures: 4H7K, 6JTT and the rest of the wrong-accept "Flow sequence"
cluster. `scan_literal_block_scalar` / `scan_folded_block_scalar` now
robustly consume all characters within the scalar's indent boundary, so
`{` / `}` inside `|` content no longer leaks to the main dispatcher.
The `flow_level == 0` bracket guards that previously broke
`tests::test_complex_yaml_document` are now safe.

### C. Multi-line scalar parent-aware indent threshold — resolved

Fixtures: **36F6, 4CQQ, FBC9** and the multi-line plain-scalar
wrong-events. Fold logic now tracks the containing block's column
separately from the abstract indent value and passes that threshold
into `scan_plain_scalar`.

### D. Eager-parse error swallowing — resolved

`BasicParser::new_eager` now surfaces parser-side validation errors
instead of `parse_all().unwrap_or(())`. The previously-hidden
partial-parse cases were each driven to a proper accept / reject via
TDD.

### E. Complex-key in `BlockMappingValue` state — resolved

Fixture **KK5P** and similar nested-complex-key cases. The `?` token
handler now covers `BlockMappingValue`: it pushes the current state,
emits `BlockMappingStart`, and transitions to `BlockMappingKey`, with
the outer value state restored when the inner mapping closes.

### F. Empty-key mappings (`: value` at line head) — resolved

Fixture **2JQS** (`: a\n: b`) and similar. At a block-mapping indent,
a leading `:` now emits `BlockMappingStart` (if needed), an empty
`Scalar` for the missing key, then the `Value` token.

### Smaller follow-ups landed at the same time

- Quoted scalars at line head detected as mapping keys (26DV, 2EBW).
- Anchor-name `:` boundary aligned with the test-suite expectation
  (2SXE).
- `---` followed by mapping on the same line treated as the test-suite
  expects (9KBC, CXX2).
- Directives mid-stream without `...` now rejected (9HCY) — unblocked
  by cluster D.
- Block-scalar header validation for malformed indent indicators
  (5LLU and friends).
- Tab-in-indentation handling made consistent (DK95/00, HS5T, 4EJS).

## Test discipline

Every fix on the path to 735 / 735 followed strict TDD, and any future
regression work should follow the same loop:

1. Identify a failing yaml-test-suite fixture.
2. Write a unit test in `src/scanner/tests` or `src/parser/tests` that
   parses the same input and asserts the expected behaviour (RED).
3. Make the smallest possible change to the parser/scanner.
4. Re-run `cargo test --lib` (GREEN).
5. Re-run `make test-yaml-suite` to confirm net-positive movement and no
   lib regressions.
6. Commit GPG-signed (no `Co-Authored-By` per project policy).

Revertable per fix; the harness produces a fresh categorized report on every
run so progress / regressions show up immediately.
